query_decomposition = """Given a user query about company financial information, analyze and structure the query according to the following requirements:

1. Company and Year Identification:
   - Extract all company names mentioned in the query
   - Extract all years mentioned in the query
   - Convert company names to lowercase
   - Create company_year combinations in the format: "companyname_year"

2. Query Decomposition Assessment:
   Determine if query decomposition is required based on these criteria:
   - Decomposition Required (true): 
        * Multiple companies are mentioned
        * Comparative analysis is requested (e.g., "compare", "versus", "vs")
        * Complex queries involving multiple financial metrics across companies
        * Questions that require separate data retrieval for different entities
   
   - Decomposition Not Required (false):
        * Single company queries
        * Simple factual questions about one entity
        * Straightforward data requests

3. Sub-query Generation (if decomposition = true):
    - Break down the original query into atomic sub-queries
    - Each sub-query should focus on one company and one specific request
    - Maintain the same financial metric/question for each company
    - Use clear, specific language
    - Ensure sub-queries can be answered independently
    - Format: "What is [specific metric] for [company] in [year]?"  

4. Output Format:
    STRICTLY DON"T ADD ANY EXPLANATIONS TO THE OUTPUT RESPONSE
    Return a JSON object with exactly this structure:
    {
        "decomposition": boolean,
        "companies_year": ["company1_year1", "company2_year2", ...],
        "queries": ["sub-query 1", "sub-query 2", ...] or []
    }


### Examples: ###
Example 1 - Simple Query:
    Input: "What was IBM total revenue in 2023?"
    Output:
    {
        "decomposition": false,
        "companies_year": ["ibm_2023"],
        "queries": []
    }

Example 2 - Comparative Query:
    Input: "Compare the Dell profit and loss with Nvidia in 2025."
    Output:
    {
        "decomposition": true,
        "companies_year": ["dell_2025", "nvidia_2025"],
        "queries": [
            "What is Dell's profit and loss in 2025?",
            "What is Nvidia's profit and loss in 2025?"
        ]
    }

Example 3 - Multiple Years, Single Company:
    Input: "How did Apple's revenue change from 2022 to 2024?"
    Output:
    {
        "decomposition": true,
        "companies_year": ["apple_2022", "apple_2024"],
        "queries": [
            "What was Apple's revenue in 2022?",
            "What was Apple's revenue in 2024?"
        ]
    }

Example 4 - Multiple Companies, Multiple Metrics:
    Input: "Show me Google's and Amazon's cash flow and debt levels for 2023."
    Output:
    {
        "decomposition": true,
        "companies_year": ["google_2023", "amazon_2023"],
        "queries": [
            "What is Google's cash flow in 2023?",
            "What is Google's debt levels in 2023?",
            "What is Amazon's cash flow in 2023?",
            "What is Amazon's debt levels in 2023?"
        ]
    }

### Key Requirements: ###
    1. Always use lowercase for company names in companies_year
    2. Maintain synchronization between company names, years, and queries - length of companies_year and queries should be the same
    3. Ensure completeness - capture all companies and years mentioned
    4. Generate specific sub-queries that can be answered independently
    5. Use consistent formatting for the JSON output
    6. Handle edge cases like multiple years or multiple metrics gracefully

### Error Handling: ###
    - If no year is mentioned, use "unknown" as the year
    - If company name is ambiguous, use the most common/formal version
    - If query is unclear, set decomposition to false and provide minimal structure

Make sure that the output is valid JSON with the above structure.

### Default companies ###
    - If it is given **all companies** then these are the companies: google, microsoft, nvidia
    - If the user asks about the company other than google, microsoft, nvidia then make the decomposition false
